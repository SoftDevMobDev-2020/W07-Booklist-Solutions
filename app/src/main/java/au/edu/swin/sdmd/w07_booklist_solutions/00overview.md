# Overview

This project was written in stages with a number of commits.

While your process might be different, this shows my approach (and the tags in order):

* starting with the layouts (new, recycler, row)
* then working on the data (data1, data2, images)
* then setting up the adapter (adapter, viewholder, almost-done, final).

After making the video I've added this file and made some minor edits to code.
